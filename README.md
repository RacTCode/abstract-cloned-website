# Cloned Abstract Website
I cloned this Abstract website to practice my CSS skills. I got the idea to clone this from Frontend Practice 
*(its a website for practicing frontend where it shows some real world websites we can clone)*

## Info
- Uses flexbox for the header, the main content and you won't believe it, the footer too! Pretty much everything in this file is made with **flexbox**.
- I did **NOT** make it interactive. (I wanted to but using media queries is hard T-T)

## Links
I provided the link to the original website so that you can check them out. You can also see how much I managed to clone it
